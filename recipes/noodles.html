    <p>This is my late mother-in-law's recipe for noodles—her favorite for flavor and because they don't spring back when you roll them. At every family gathering she'd make the best chicken and noodles, dropping her prepared noodles into homemade chicken broth along with shredded cooked chicken, then serving them over mashed potatoes. I've made them many times and everyone loves them. When making multiple batches, and lacking counter space, I hang the rounds on clean plastic hangers to dry.</p>
